# JPEG Discriminator 

A simple JPEG discriminator developed for cs 590k. Tweak and adjust values for entropy, LN and buffer size to improve results. 

You can test it with `python disc.py <positive_samples> <negative_samples>` 

#The ORDER OF DIRS is important! Don't make the first argument negative_samples!  

Have fun!
